Raw data for testing with realistic but synthetic data.

## üõ† Usage

This package just contains data sets, so it can be used with all sorts of
other libraries. The intended usage is with a property-based testing framework
like [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check), and all advanced
examples in this documentation will use fast-check.

The initial data sets come from faker.js and this project
was inspired by faker.js being abandoned by its creator.

### Basic usage

Import the data set you want to use
```ts
import { firstNames } from 'raw-data';
// ['Alfred', 'Bertram', ...]
```

and create arbitraries from them:

```ts
import { firstNames, lastNames } from "raw-data";
import {
  assert,
  constantFrom,
  emailAddress,
  property,
  record,
} from "fast-check";

function isValidUser(user: any) {
  return (
    user != null &&
    user.firstName !== undefined &&
    user.lastName !== undefined &&
    user.email !== undefined
  );
}

const arbitraryUser = record({
  firstName: constantFrom(...firstNames),
  lastName: constantFrom(...lastNames),
  email: emailAddress(),
});

describe("isValidUser", () => {
  it("accepts a valid user", () => {
    assert(
      property(arbitraryUser, (user) => {
        expect(isValidUser(user)).toBe(true);
      })
    );
  });
});
```

These can then also be used to create example data:

```ts
import { firstNames, lastNames } from "raw-data";
import { constantFrom, emailAddress, record, sample } from "fast-check";

interface User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
}

const arbitraryUser = record({
  firstName: constantFrom(...firstNames),
  lastName: constantFrom(...lastNames),
  email: emailAddress(),
});

function generateUser(overrides: Partial<User> = {}) {
  return { ...sample(arbitraryUser, 1)[0], ...overrides };
}

it("generates a user", () => {
  expect(generateUser({ email: "test@test.com" })).toMatchObject({
    firstName: expect.any(String),
    lastName: expect.any(String),
    email: "test@test.com",
  });
});

```
